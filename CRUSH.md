# Board Bazaar Project Guide

## Project Overview
Board Bazaar is a website showcasing various signboard and office designs across multiple categories including cooperative offices, medical facilities, restaurants, and infrastructure projects.

## Development Commands
Since this is a static asset collection project, there are no build/test/lint commands currently available. The project consists primarily of:
- Image assets organized by category
- Website design mockups
- Static content files

## Project Structure
- `assets/` - Main asset directory containing:
  - `co operative office/` - Office signboard images
  - `medical and hospital/` - Medical facility images  
  - `hotels and restaurent/` - Restaurant signboard images
  - `store signboard/` - Commercial store images
  - `building and infra/` - Infrastructure project images
- `websie desgine photo/` - Website design mockups

## Asset Organization Guidelines
- Maintain consistent naming convention: IMG-YYYYMMDD-WA####.jpg
- Keep images organized by category in respective folders
- Use descriptive folder names with spaces for readability (existing convention)
- Website mockups should follow sequential naming (first.png, second.png, etc.)

## File Naming Conventions
- Images: Use existing WhatsApp naming pattern
- Folders: Use descriptive names with spaces (maintaining current style)
- Website mockups: Sequential naming with descriptive terms

## Development Notes
This appears to be a content-heavy project focusing on image organization and display. Future web development would likely involve:
- Creating a responsive gallery system
- Implementing category filtering
- Adding image metadata and descriptions
- Setting up a static site generator or web framework
